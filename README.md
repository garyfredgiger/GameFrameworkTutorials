GameFrameworkTutorials
======================

A set of short tutorials showing how to use the GameFramework

When you clone this project, make sure you also clone the *[GameFramework](https://github.com/garyfredgiger/GameFramework.git)* project in this same repo. The GameFramework project is required for these tutorials and examples. Import both projects into Eclipse and before building the project, make sure you add the GameFramework project to this project under the menu options as described below.

<ol>
<li>Right click on the project and select the option Build Path -> Configure Build Path</li>
<li>Click on the Projects tab and add the GameFramework project, then click the OK button.</li>
</ol>

NOTE: I included the eclipse project files (.project and .classpath) in this project so you can simply import this project without having to create a new project from your cloned copy of the code. Some suggest it is not a good idea to include project specific files, but I thought I would be a rebel and do it anyway.

This game was developed using Eclipse Kepler Release (Build id: 20130614-0229) with Java 1.6.
